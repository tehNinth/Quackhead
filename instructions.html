  <title>Quackhead - Duck Game Hat Pack Creation Tool - Instructions</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Quackhead Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Quackhead will allow you to create hat packs without doing any coding at all!<br/>
    This page provides instructions detailing the process of creating a hat pack.
  </p>
  <h3>1. Understanding the hat images</h3>
  <p>
    First, choose an image editor. Use anything except MS Paint.<br/>
    I recommend Paint.NET if you are new to image editing, get it <a href="http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html">Here</a>. (The download page has ads that look like download links, so use adblock or be careful not to click them.)<br/>
    The template is a 64x32 image, this image will animate between two frames when you quack (the left half and right half of the image).<br/>
    If using GIMP or Photshop, use the PSD template. If using Paint.NET, use the PDN template.<br/>
    Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duckgame/comments/3o0q0p/the_ultimate_duck_game_hat_template/">/u/BeardedBears</a> for the layered template<br/>
    Ultimate PSD Template: <a href="image/template.psd">DOWNLOAD</a> (for Photoshop, GIMP, and others)<br/>
    Ultimate PDN Template: <a href="image/template.pdn">DOWNLOAD</a> (for Paint.NET)<br/>
    Flat PNG Template: <img src="image/template.png" /> (right click, then click "Save image as").<br/>
    If using the ultimate templates, there's a reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duckgame/comments/3o0q0p/the_ultimate_duck_game_hat_template/">here</a> with the creators notes<br/>
    You should draw your hats on a layer in front of this template, and export them as transparent PNG files without the template layer(s).<br/>
    If using photoshop, be sure to save the PNG files with the "interlaced" option, as otherwise the file size may end up too large to be a hat.<br/>
  </p>
  <h3>2. Adding hats to your hat pack</h3>
  <p>
    When finished creating your hat textures, go to the quackhead webpage (<a href="quackhead.html">here</a>).<br/>
    Click "Add Team" and select the png files you created<br/>
    For each team type a team name.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Exporting as .hat files</h3>
  <p>
    Hat files will allow you to use your hats in multiplayer games. Everyone will be able to see your hat, without any mod being needed!<br/>
    They are, however, not "official". So if you have problems, try removing them before anything else.<br/>
    Click "Export as .hat files" at the top.<br/>
    Extract the .hat files from the zip, if you downloaded more than one.<br/>
    Move the downloaded .hat files into your duck game folder, this is usually at something like<br/>
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Duck Game\<br/>
    Then start duck game, your hats should be in your hat selector.<br/>
    If you don't need to export as a mod pack, you're done! Otherwise read on.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Exporting as a Hat Mania Package</h3>
  <p>
    Hat Mania packages allow people using the mod "Hat File Mania" to wear and save the hat.<br/>
    While in-game, people using the mod <abbr title="Hat File Mania">HFM</abbr> can directly copy hats as .hat files via the F11 menu added by <abbr title="Hat File Mania">HFM</abbr><br/>
    A Hat Mania package is a mod that carries .hat files across the workshop, and automatically disables itself when downloaded.<br/>
    To generate a Hat Mania package:<br/>
    Click "Export as Modpack" at the top.<br/>
    Fill in the following fields, described below:<br/>
    "Name" - Unique Name for your mod<br/>
    "Description" - One line description of your mod<br/>
    "Author" - Name / Username of the mod creator<br/>
    "Version" - Must be a number, describes the version of your mod. If you leave it blank it will say "1.0.0.0" when you download it.<br/>
    Once done, click "Download as Hat Mania package"
  </p>
  <h3>5. Exporting as a Standard Mod Pack</h3>
  <p>
    Standard mod packs allow people using the mod to wear the hat, but currently they can ONLY play with other people using the mod.<br/>
    You may not want to use this unless you have a group of people who will agree to play using your mod.<br/>
    To generate a Standard Mod Pack:<br/>
    Click "Export as Modpack" at the top.<br/>
    Fill in the following fields, described below:<br/>
    "Name" - Unique Name for your mod<br/>
    "Description" - One line description of your mod<br/>
    "Author" - Name / Username of the mod creator<br/>
    "Version" - Must be a number, describes the version of your mod.<br/>
    Once done, click "Download Exported Modpack"
  </p>
  <h3>6. Testing your mod pack</h3>
  <p>
    For any Mod type: Open the .zip file, and copy the folder inside to your Documents/Duck Game/Mods folder<br/>
    <br/>
    For Hat Mania Packages:<br/>
    Subscribe to Hat File Mania on the Steam workshop before continuing:<br/>
    <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=877990149">http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=877990149</a><br/>
    Then start Duck Game and press the F11 key.<br/>
    Navigate through "Save Hat Mania" and find your modpack in the list, (it should be at the top) then select it.<br/>
    Make sure all your hats are visible.<br/>
    If you have problems, you can remove the mod from your Mods folder to get things back to normal.<br/>
    <br/>
    For Standard Mod Packs:
    Start Duck Game, and as soon as you can, try to change your hat. Check that your new hats work correctly.<br/>
    Be aware that with mod packs, you can ONLY play with people that have the exact same combination of mod packs<br/>
    If you have problems, you can remove the mod from your Mods folder to get things back to normal.<br/>
  </p>
  <h3>7. Adding a thumbnail</h3>
  <p>
    (this step is completely optional, but recommended)<br/>
    The thumbnail is a square image that will be shown on the mod browser.<br/>
    Create a 1:1 png file (256x256 is a good resolution for this) and name it "preview.png".<br/>
    Put it in the "Content" folder inside the mod directory, replacing the existing image.
  </p>
  <h3>8. Adding a screenshot</h3>
  <p>
    (this step is also completely optional, but recommended)<br/>
    The screenshot is a high resolution image that will be shown on the workshop.<br/>
    Create a 16:9 png file (something like 1280x720 or 1920x1080) and name it "screenshot.png".<br/>
    Put in the "Content" folder inside the mod directory, replacing the existing image.
  </p>
  <h3>9. Publishing</h3>
  <p>
    You can publish your mod so other people can use it. In the settings page, go to "Manage Mods".<br/>
    From there, you can publish your mod.<br/>
    <br/>
    Once you have published your Mod:<br/>
    If it is a Hat Mania package, it is recommended that you click "Add/Remove Required Items" in the OWNER CONTROLS panel,
    then add Hat File Mania as a required item to ensure that people will see your hats in-game.
